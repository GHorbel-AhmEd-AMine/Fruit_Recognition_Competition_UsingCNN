# -Fruit_Recognition_Competition_UsingCNN-

# Problem Overview 
Deep learning has been proved to be an advanced technology for big data analysis with a large number of successful cases in image processing, speech recognition, object detection,
and so on. It has also been introduced in food science and engineering, and agriculture technology. There are some research papers already published for the applications like food
recognition, leaves recognition, fruits and vegetable recognition, identification of healthier food, etc.

**Descreption of the Dataset**

1° train - contains all the images that are to be used for training your model.

2° Training_set.csv - this csv file has contains the labels for the training images

3° test - contains 9000+ images. For these images you are required to make predictions

4° Testing_set.csv - this is the order of the predictions for each image that is to be submitted on the platform. Make sure the predictions you submit are with their image’s filename in the same order as given in this file.

5° sample_submission.csv- this is the sample submission file for the data sprint

# How to use this

# Requirements
The requirements.txt file, has all the packages that were in the environment at the time of training.

Tensorflow 2.0 (Tensorflow-GPU was used)
Keras 2.3.1
Matplotlib
Numpy

# Usage
The Images to be predicted are saved in the test.csv file.

Run the notebook with google colaboratory .

**Transfer Learning**
Transfer learning is a machine learning method where a model developed for a task is reused as the starting point for a model on a second task.

# Achievements 
I have achieved an accuracy of 99.99 % on the test set using VGG16.
100+ views on my notebook.
