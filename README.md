**Fruit_Recognition_Competition_UsingCNN**

Deep learning has been proved to be an advanced technology for big data analysis with a large number of successful cases in image processing, speech recognition, object detection,
and so on. It has also been introduced in food science and engineering, and agriculture technology. There are some research papers already published for the applications like food
recognition, leaves recognition, fruits and vegetable recognition, identification of healthier food, etc.
